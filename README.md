Plant diseases represent a significant threat to global agricultural productivity and food security, necessitating the development of effective detection and management strategies. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating the detection of plant diseases through image analysis. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of CNN-based methodologies in the context of plant disease detection, covering a wide range of aspects to offer a comprehensive understanding of their application in agricultural settings.

The review commences by elucidating the foundational principles of CNNs and their pivotal role in computer vision tasks, emphasizing their suitability for analysing leaf images for disease diagnosis. It discusses the intricate architectures of various CNN models commonly employed in plant disease detection, including seminal models like AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and Inception, thereby shedding light on their respective strengths and limitations in this domain.

Moreover, the review evaluates the performance of CNN-based plant disease detection models through a comprehensive analysis of various evaluation metrics, including but not limited to accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score. It also addresses the inherent challenges and potential future directions in CNN-based plant disease detection, highlighting the imperative for developing robust models capable of accommodating environmental variability and diverse disease manifestations.
